# LangDetect.js

Based on awesome highlight.js by Ivan Sagalaev. Checkout github https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js for all technicalities on pattern recognition


## Note

You will need to have setup node before we can proceed with anything.

## Basic Usage

You will need to edit langdetect.js to output the result the way you want. And ofcourse rebuild the minified version of the script. this is pretty initial stage.

## Test Cases

running ./test.sh will generate test results for all language samples in the tests folder. You can find my output in test_results.

## Customization

you can use all the settings mentioned by Ivan on github (upto v7.5) but again you will need to edit langdetect.js to output the result the way you want. And ofcourse rebuild the minified version of the script.
